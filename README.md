## Features

- Generates unique tokens using your device's camera

## Usage

- Open the EntropyKey web application.
- Click the "Generate Token" button to start the process.
- Allow the application to access your camera when prompted.
- A unique token will be generated and displayed.
- Click the clipboard icon next to the token to copy it to your  clipboard.
